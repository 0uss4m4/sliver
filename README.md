Sliver
======

![Sliver](/sliver/sliver.jpeg)

Sliver is a general implant framework that supports C2 over Mutual-TLS, HTTP(S), and DNS. Implants are dynamically compiled with unique X.509 certificates signed by a per-instance certificate authority generated when you first run the binary. 

## Source Code

The source code repo contains the following directories:

 * `assets/` - Static assets that are embedded into the server binary, generated by `go-assets.sh`
 * `client/` - Client code, the majority of this code is also used by the server
 * `server/` - Server-side code
 * `sliver/` - Implant code, rendered by the server at runtime

## Compile From Source

Just run the `build.py` script (requires Docker), or for details, see the [wiki](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Compile-From-Source).
