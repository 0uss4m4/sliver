* Compile-time obfuscation
* Local and remote process injection
* Anti-anti-anti-forensics
* Secure C2 over mTLS, HTTP(S), and DNS
* Windows process migration
* Windows user token manipulation
* Multiplayer-mode
* Procedurally generated C2 over HTTP
* Let's Encrypt integration
* In-memory .NET assembly execution
* [DNS Canary](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/DNS-C2#dns-canaries) Blue Team Detection

### Getting Started

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases) and see the Sliver [wiki](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Getting-Started) for a quick tutorial on basic setup and usage.

### Source Code

The source code repo contains the following directories:

 * `assets/` - Static assets that are embedded into the server binary, generated by `go-assets.sh`
 * `client/` - Client code, the majority of this code is also used by the server
 * `protobuf/` - Protobuf code
 * `server/` - Server-side code
 * `sliver/` - Implant code, rendered by the server at runtime
 * `util/` - Utility functions that may be shared by the server and client
